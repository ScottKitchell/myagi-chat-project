# myagi-chat-project

## Setup
The project is built with Angular 6. There isn't anything really to see if you run the app at this stage so I wouldn't really bother. If you do want to run it see the [Angular Setup Guide](https://angular.io/guide/setup).

## File of interest
The files to look at:
+ `src/app/messaging.service.ts`
+ `src/app/models.ts`
+ `src/app/fake-db.ts`


There's also a few initialised UI components but I didn't get around to doing anything with them.
